# EC601-homework2
This lesson gets us familiar with Xcode, the tool we use to write apps. We can become familiar with the structure of a project in Xcode and learn how to navigate between and use basic project components. In the lesson, we’ll start making a simple user interface (UI) for the FoodTracker app and view it in the simulator. When you’re finished, your app will have a label for the meal’s name, a text field to change the meal’s name, and a button for resetting the name.

To build and run your app, use the iOS Simulator app that’s included in Xcode. The simulator gives you an idea of how your app would look and behave if it were running on a device. The simulator can model a number of different types of hardware—All the screen sizes and resolutions for both iPad and iPhone—so you can simulate your app on every device you’re developing for. In this lesson, use the iPhone 7 option.

Then, connect the basic user interface (UI) of the FoodTracker app to code and define some actions a user can perform in that UI.
